# DirectAudio integration

**DirectAudio** is a native Wine → Android AAudio mmdevapi driver by
[The412Banner](https://github.com/The412Banner/directaudio), licensed LGPL-2.1-or-later.
WinNative ships his release binaries unmodified and adds only the host-side plumbing. This
document covers what the driver does, why it is the only audio path here that can carry a
microphone, and what the app does to select and configure it.

## Why the other two stacks cannot do microphone input

This is structural, not missing configuration.

**ALSA (custom aserver).** The wire protocol between the guest ALSA plugin and the app's Java
server has eight request codes — `CLOSE START STOP PAUSE PREPARE WRITE DRAIN POINTER`
(`runtime/audio/alsaserver/RequestCodes.java`) — and every one is output-side. There is no
`READ`. The guest plugin does not even reach the socket for a capture PCM:

```c
/* audio_plugin/module_pcm_android_aserver.c:317 */
if (stream != SND_PCM_STREAM_PLAYBACK) return -ENOTSUP;
```

Adding capture here means designing a new verb on both sides of the socket plus an
`AudioRecord` feeder in `ALSAClient`. That is a new subsystem.

**PulseAudio.** The bundled `pulseaudio.tzst` asset contains exactly `libprotocol-native.so`,
`module-aaudio-sink.so`, `module-native-protocol-unix.so` and `pactl`, and
`PulseAudioComponent` loads only the protocol module and the sink. There is no source module of
any kind, so a capture endpoint winepulse advertises records silence or a monitor tap rather
than the microphone.

**DirectAudio.** There is no daemon in the path at all — the driver talks AAudio directly from
Wine's unixlib, so it is both the mmdevapi backend and the device layer. The capture half of
the WASAPI vtable was always wired; v1.3.2 exposes the endpoint and backs it with a real AAudio
input stream.

---

## How the driver's capture path works

It is the render mixer, inverted: one shared AAudio `INPUT` stream whose data callback fans PCM
out to every registered capture voice, reusing the render ring fields with the producer and
consumer roles swapped (the same approach Wine's own `winecoreaudio.drv` uses). That sharing is
why `create_stream`, the per-period stream event and the vtable did not need duplicating.

| Stage | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Gate | `BANNER_AUDIO_DIRECT_MIC` is read **once** at process attach. Default off. |
| Enumerate | With the gate off, `get_endpoint_ids` reports **zero** capture endpoints. |
| Open | First capture `create_stream` lazily opens the AAudio input — 48 kHz / float / stereo, `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` preset (platform AEC / NS / AGC). Enumeration alone never gets here. |
| Start | `requestStart` is deferred until the first `Start`, so the mic goes hot no earlier than the game actually records. |
| Produce | The callback rate-converts with a carried fractional position, folds channels, writes the client sample format, and drops the oldest frame on overrun. |
| Consume | `get_capture_buffer` serves device-period chunks, returning `AUDCLNT_S_BUFFER_EMPTY` until a full period is held. |
| Teardown | Last voice out → `requestStop` (the OS recording indicator clears), stream stays open for reuse. |

The driver honours the geometry AAudio actually grants rather than what it asked for, so a mono
microphone or a device-native rate still works. Capture gain is deliberately **not** scaled by
the stream volumes — the `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` auto-gain owns the mic level and a WASAPI capture
"volume" on top of it would fight the platform AGC.

### Why the gate is off by default

A capture endpoint a game can enumerate but **not** open makes titles that probe the microphone
during load abandon audio initialisation and boot to a black screen. God of War and DiRT 3 are
the upstream device-proven examples. With `BANNER_AUDIO_DIRECT_MIC` unset the driver is
byte-identical to its render-only build: no capture endpoints, every capture op returns
`AUDCLNT_E_DEVICE_INVALIDATED`, and no AAudio input object is ever constructed.

---

## What WinNative does

All host-side logic lives in
[`runtime/audio/directaudio/DirectAudioDriver.kt`](../app/src/main/runtime/audio/directaudio/DirectAudioDriver.kt).

### Driver selection and overlay

Two axes decide which bundled build is installed:

- **mmdevapi unixlib ABI** — the driver plugs straight into mmdevapi's unixlib table, so the
  build that fits is a property of the Proton binary, not of its version string. Both the driver
  and every Proton's own `winealsa.so` export `__wine_unix_call_funcs`, whose size is that table:
  **36** entries for Proton 9.0 and 10.0-4, **37** for Proton 11.x. `DirectAudioDriver` reads the
  count out of `<layer>/lib/wine/aarch64-unix/winealsa.so` and picks the bundled build whose own
  unixlib reports the same count. No version parsing, so custom, GE and beta Protons work on the
  same footing as the stock ones, and a Proton whose table matches neither build is refused
  instead of being handed a mismatched driver.
- **Kernel page size** — `sdk35` for a 16 KB-page kernel (`p_align` 0x4000), `sdk28` for the
  classic 4 KB (0x1000), read via `Os.sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)`. Loading the wrong one fails to map.
  Nothing else in the app needed page size before, so the check is new.

The `wine10`/`wine11` asset names are historical — the wine10 build serves Proton 9.0 as well,
which the old version table refused outright.

A Wine 11 `.drv` has **no PE export table**, and that is correct: Wine 11's own `winealsa.drv`
and `winepulse.drv` have exactly the same shape, because the `.drv` is a generic unixlib host
there and the driver logic lives entirely in the `.so`. Only Wine 10 and earlier resolve
`get_device_guid` / `get_device_name_from_guid` through PE exports.

The complete 3-file set is then overlaid onto the container's Wine layer, stamped by bundled
version + variant so it is a no-op on every launch after the first:

```
lib/wine/aarch64-windows/winedirectaudio.drv   arm64ec PE  — 64-bit guest games
lib/wine/i386-windows/winedirectaudio.drv      32-bit PE   — wow64 guest games
lib/wine/aarch64-unix/winedirectaudio.so       bionic unixlib — the AAudio backend
```

Which PE the loader picks is decided by the **guest game's** bitness, not the device, so both PE
halves are always installed alongside the shared unixlib.

### Making the unixlib loadable (the AAudio bridge)

Upstream's `winedirectaudio.so` declares `DT_NEEDED libaaudio.so`. `libaaudio.so` is a **public**
Android soname (`/system/etc/public.libraries.txt`), so bionic force-resolves it from the system
namespace, and the real `/system/lib64/libaaudio.so` pulls in the Android framework closure
(libbinder, libutils, libhidlbase, VNDK/APEX). WinNative's Wine unixlib runs in a linker namespace
that cannot link that closure, so the stock unixlib fails to load with `STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND`
(`c0000135`) and mmdevapi produces silence with **no** fallback.

### Staging the driver where mmdevapi can find it

`mmdevapi` resolves the backend with `LoadLibraryW(L"winedirectaudio.drv")`, which searches the
**container's Wine prefix** (`drive_c/windows/system32`, and `syswow64` for wow64 guests) — not the
Wine layer the overlay writes to. Every other backend is already in the prefix because the container
pattern was built with them; `winedirectaudio.drv` is new, so it is absent and the load fails with
`STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND` (`126` / `c0000135`) **before the unixlib is ever reached**. That failure looks
identical to a missing-dependency problem and is easy to misdiagnose as an AAudio/linker issue.

`DirectAudioDriver.mirrorIntoPrefix()` therefore copies both PE halves from the layer into the prefix
after the overlay, size-gated so it is a no-op once staged. This is the same thing
`WinComponentSetup.restoreWineBuiltinDllFiles` does for the stock builtins, and it is what makes the
driver work on a container created before DirectAudio existed.

Once the PE loads, two further pieces keep the unixlib loadable, entirely in the emulator, so any
Proton layer works unchanged:

1. **`DirectAudioDriver.patchDirectAudioNeeded()`** rewrites the unixlib's `DT_NEEDED` string
   `libaaudio.so` → `libwaudio.so` in place (same length) after the overlay. It runs on every
   install and is idempotent. `libwaudio.so` is a **non-public** soname, so bionic resolves it from
   `usr/lib` via `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` instead of the system namespace.
2. **`libwaudio.so`** is WinNative's own AAudio bridge, built by the app
   (`app/src/main/cpp/wnaudiohook/wn_aaudio_shim.c` → CMake target `waudio`) and staged into
   `imagefs/usr/lib` by `GuestProgramLauncherComponent` when DirectAudio is selected — the same
   `ensureImageFsNativeLibrary` path `libnetshim.so` uses. It exports only the 27 `AAudio_*` symbols
   the driver imports, links only `log dl` (never `android`, whose closure is the same framework
   stack), and **never** exports `dlopen` (an injected `dlopen` stalls the Steam launcher). On first
   call it builds a namespace linked to the platform default set, `android_dlopen_ext`s the real
   `/system/lib64/libaaudio.so` through it, and forwards each call.

This is host-side only: the shipped driver zips stay byte-verbatim (see `assets/directaudio/`),
the rename happens on-device, and nothing is baked into a specific Proton build. A future driver
that folds the bridge into the unixlib itself — removing both the rename and the separate shim — is
staged at https://github.com/WinNative-Emu/directaudio (`winnative/self-contained-aaudio`); once its
CI builds the four artifacts and they are device-verified, dropping them here retires both pieces
above.

### Driver activation

`changeWineAudioDriver()` in `XServerDisplayActivity` writes the Wine registry key that selects
the backend — `Software\Wine\Drivers` → `Audio` = `directaudio`. Selecting DirectAudio adds no
environment component and opens no socket, because there is no daemon to start.

That registry key is the whole activation, so it must never name a driver that is not on disk:
`mmdevapi` fails its `LoadLibraryW`, `CoCreateInstance(MMDeviceEnumerator)` fails with it, and a
title that initialises audio while loading does not start at all. The failure looks like a hung
launch, not like a missing sound device.

`resolveAudioDriver()` therefore runs the overlay **before** the registry is written and, when it
cannot complete, drops the launch back to `Container.DEFAULT_AUDIO_DRIVER` — the registry then
names PulseAudio, the PulseAudio component is added like any other launch, and a toast says why.
The container's own saved choice is untouched, so the next launch retries the install.

`install()` reports that honestly: no bundled build matching the layer's unixlib ABI, a failed
stage into the prefix, or a unixlib with neither `libaaudio.so` nor `libwaudio.so` in its dynamic
section all return `false` rather than logging and returning success. A refused driver is also
deleted from `system32`/`syswow64`, so a prefix staged by an earlier build does not keep a dead
`winedirectaudio.drv` around.

Order matters: `resolveAudioDriver()` runs **after** `setupWineSystemFiles()`, because
`ensureWinePrefixReady()` can move a broken `.wine` aside and extract a fresh prefix. Staging
the driver before that would put it in the directory that is about to become
`.wine.broken-backup`.

The version it is asked about must be the Wine **identifier** (`proton-11.0-6-arm64ec`), not
`WineInfo.fullVersion()` (`11.0-6`) — `wineAbiTag()` requires the `arm64ec` arch in the string and
rejects everything else, so passing the bare version makes every install fail.

### Microphone opt-in

The toggle is per container and per shortcut (extra `directAudioMic`), surfaced in the audio
settings only when DirectAudio is the selected driver, and defaulted off. Turning it on requests
`RECORD_AUDIO` immediately rather than at app start.

At launch, `BANNER_AUDIO_DIRECT_MIC=1` is set only when the user opted in **and** the permission
is actually granted. That second condition matters: setting the gate without the permission
would advertise a capture endpoint the AAudio input cannot open, which is precisely the
black-screen condition above. Withholding it degrades to render-only instead.

---

## Verifying on a device

Run with the upstream diagnostics build plus `BANNER_AUDIO_DIRECT_LOG=1` and watch logcat for
the `DirectAudio` tag. The open line reports the geometry AAudio actually granted, which is the
first thing to check when audio is present but wrong:

```
capture open: req 48000/float/2ch preset=voicecomm perf=1 - got rate=48000 ch=1 fmt=2
capture start
```

Upstream validated a real microphone recording and TF2's Options → Voice mic-test meter on an
AYANEO Pocket FIT (Adreno 750, Android 14). Reproduce that first.

## GameScope sessions

A GameScope container runs Valve's ARM64 Proton under glibc, where the bionic unixlib cannot load
and there is no `libaaudio` to call. The driver's source is the same; what changes is who opens
the stream.

- `tools/linuxfs/directaudio/build-directaudio.sh` builds upstream's `directaudio.c`, unmodified,
  for aarch64 glibc against the headers of Valve's Wine 11 (pinned commit), and links it with
  `wn_aaudio_client.c`: the 27 `AAudio_*` entry points, implemented as a client of the app. The
  result ships as `assets/directaudio/linux/winedirectaudio.so`; the two PE halves are upstream's
  own, taken from the `wine11` archive.
- `DirectAudioHost` (`libwnaudiohost.so`) listens on a unix socket inside the session. One
  connection is one stream: open/start/stop/close go over the socket, the PCM goes through a ring
  in `ASharedMemory` whose descriptor rides on the open reply, and the real AAudio data callback
  wakes the client's pump thread through a futex after every burst. The protocol is
  `app/src/main/cpp/wnaudiohook/wn_aaudio_protocol.h`.
- PulseAudio always runs in these sessions, because the Steam client and native games know
  nothing else. DirectAudio only takes the Windows games.
- `winnative-directaudio <steam root> on|off` runs at session start. It copies the driver into
  every Proton whose `winealsa.so` walks the same unixlib table (37 entries today; the x86 Proton
  has no `aarch64-unix` and is left alone), and writes or removes `Audio=directaudio` in each
  prefix that Proton runs, templates included. With the driver off the value is removed, so a
  prefix never names a driver its session cannot serve.
- Capture is refused by the host unless the mic opt-in and `RECORD_AUDIO` both hold, the same
  gate as a Wine session.

Measured on a RedMagic (Brawlhalla, 48 kHz float stereo): no underruns after the stream's first
half second, 76 ms reported track latency against 116 ms for the PulseAudio track beside it. That
device denies `AUDIO_OUTPUT_FLAG_FAST` to every app track, this one included, so the burst is
960 frames; a device that grants it gets the fast mixer with no change here.

## Known gaps

Upstream's own honest list, plus what applies on the WinNative side:

| Gap | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **No capture watchdog** | The render side has a dead-callback watchdog. The capture struct declares `cb_count` and `last_cb_ns`, but they are written and never read — the instrumentation exists, the watchdog does not. |
| **Failed reopen keeps a dead stream** | If reopening the input fails after a route change, nothing retries it and the mic is lost for the session. |
| **Latency floor** | An open input stream may knock the output off the AAudio fast path on some devices. Unmeasured — upstream flags this as the one item that could threaten the latency floor. |
| **Online voice round-trip** | Mic → VAC server → second player has not been validated end to end by anyone. An in-game meter moving proves capture, not transport. |
| **Device spread** | AAudio input under FEX is proven on one device. WinNative's spread is much wider. |
| **Background microphone** | Android 9+ silences mic input for apps with no foreground process, regardless of target SDK. `SessionKeepAliveService` is declared `specialUse\|dataSync` with no `microphone` foreground-service type — fine while the game is foregrounded, silent when it is not. |
| **`targetSdk 28`** | Android 14's foreground-service-type enforcement does not apply at this target. Add the `microphone` FGS type when the target is raised. |

## Updating the bundled driver

1. Download the new release artifacts into `app/src/main/assets/directaudio/` (command in
   `PROVENANCE.md`), and refresh the checksums recorded there.
2. Bump `BUNDLED_VERSION` in `DirectAudioDriver.kt` so existing containers re-overlay.
3. Copy `COPYING`, `NOTICE` and `AUTHORS` again if upstream changed them.

If you ever need to build from source rather than ship his binaries, upstream's `INTEGRATION.md`
has the recipe: add the repo as a submodule at `dlls/winedirectaudio.drv` in the Proton tree —
which is also what keeps his commit history intact — apply ~10 lines to `configure.ac` and
`dlls/mmdevapi/main.c`, then `./configure --enable-archs=arm64ec --with-aaudio`.
